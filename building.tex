\section*{Problem Description}
The problem that I will be writing about is this. A person is working at an experimental balloon manufacturer as a tester. What makes this company special is that they know all of their balloons will pop at exactly the same height if dropped. The company doesn't have a formal lab to test their balloons in so they test them by going to each floor of the building they have an office in and drop the balloons filled with water out of a window and check to see if the balloon pops. How many drop tests does it take for them to be able to isololate the floor number that takes a batch of balloons from not poping to poping.\\

\section*{The Uniform Random Variable Case}
In this case the tester can use a binary search. Starting at the $\myfloor{\frac{n}{2}}$
